# Pig Dice Game

#### A game of dice

#### By **Maya Frame and Marguerite Kennedy**

## Description

A dice "jeopardy" game created with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.


### Specs

. Activate generator on "roll" click

. Game ends when one user totals 100
